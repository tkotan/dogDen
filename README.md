<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

First off, I express my utmost respect and gratitude to the instructional team (especially James Haff) at General Assembly.  They are a great group of educators.

Many thanks to all of the kind people in the IT community who freely share their knowledge with those who love to learn.  I would also like to thank my family for being patient with me.  Lastly, I want to thank my children for teaching me how to be a kid again ;)
